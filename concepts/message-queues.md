Message queues are asynchronous communication mechanisms that enable decoupled communication between different parts of a system or between different systems. They allow producers to send messages to a queue without waiting for consumers to process them and consumers to process messages at their own pace. This pattern is fundamental for building scalable and resilient distributed systems. Key concepts include producers which are services that send messages to the queue consumers which are services that receive and process messages from the queue brokers which are the message queue servers that store and route messages topics or exchanges which are logical channels for organizing messages and queues which are buffers that hold messages until consumed. Popular message queue systems include RabbitMQ which uses AMQP protocol and supports complex routing Apache Kafka which is designed for high-throughput event streaming AWS SQS which is a fully managed queue service and Redis which can be used as a lightweight message broker. Message delivery semantics include at-most-once where messages may be lost but never delivered twice suitable for non-critical data at-least-once where messages are never lost but may be delivered multiple times requiring idempotent consumers and exactly-once where messages are delivered exactly one time which is hardest to achieve but ensures data integrity. Benefits of message queues include decoupling where producers and consumers operate independently without knowing about each other load leveling where queues absorb traffic spikes allowing consumers to process at a steady rate reliability as messages are persisted until successfully processed scalability as consumers can be added or removed based on queue depth and asynchronous processing where long-running tasks don't block the main application flow. Common patterns include point-to-point where each message is consumed by exactly one consumer publish-subscribe where messages are broadcast to multiple subscribers request-reply for synchronous-like communication over async infrastructure and dead letter queues for handling messages that cannot be processed.
