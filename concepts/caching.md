Caching is the technique of storing copies of frequently accessed data in a fast storage layer to reduce access time and load on the primary data source. Caches can exist at multiple levels including browser cache CDN cache application cache and database cache. Common caching strategies include Cache-Aside where the application checks the cache first and loads from the database on a miss then populates the cache Read-Through where the cache sits in front of the database and automatically loads data on a miss Write-Through where writes go to both cache and database synchronously ensuring consistency and Write-Behind where writes go to cache immediately and are asynchronously written to the database later providing better write performance but risking data loss. Cache eviction policies determine which items to remove when the cache is full. LRU Least Recently Used removes items that haven't been accessed recently LFU Least Frequently Used removes items accessed least often FIFO First In First Out removes oldest items first and Random eviction removes random items. Cache invalidation is one of the hardest problems in computer science involving strategies like TTL Time To Live where cached items expire after a set time Event-based invalidation where cache is cleared on data updates and Version-based invalidation using versioned keys. Distributed caching solutions like Redis and Memcached provide shared cache across multiple application servers ensuring consistency and high availability. CDNs cache static content like images CSS and JavaScript at edge locations close to users reducing latency. Cache warming involves pre-loading cache with frequently accessed data. Cache stampede occurs when many requests for an expired cache item hit the database simultaneously which can be mitigated with cache locking. Benefits of caching include reduced latency improved application performance reduced database load and cost savings by serving more requests with less infrastructure.
