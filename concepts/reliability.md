Reliability is the probability that a system will perform its intended function correctly over a specified period of time under stated conditions. A reliable system continues to work correctly even when facing hardware failures software bugs or unexpected load. Reliability is closely related to availability but focuses more on correctness and consistency rather than just uptime. A system can be available but unreliable if it returns incorrect results. Key aspects of reliability include fault tolerance which is the ability to continue operating properly in the event of failures graceful degradation where the system provides reduced functionality rather than complete failure and error handling to detect catch and recover from errors appropriately. Achieving reliability requires comprehensive testing including unit tests integration tests load tests and chaos engineering to simulate failures. Monitoring and observability are crucial for reliability allowing teams to detect issues quickly through metrics logs and distributed tracing. Automated alerting notifies teams of problems before they impact users. Database transactions with ACID properties ensure data reliability by maintaining consistency even during failures. Idempotent operations ensure that repeating the same operation multiple times has the same effect as doing it once preventing duplicate charges or data corruption. Checksums and data validation ensure data integrity during transmission and storage. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services. Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff handle transient failures gracefully. Regular disaster recovery drills ensure that backup and recovery procedures work correctly when needed.
