ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties ensure reliable transaction processing in databases where Atomicity guarantees transactions execute completely or not at all with rollback reverting all changes if any operation fails (like transferring money requiring both debit and credit to succeed together), Consistency ensures database transitions from one valid state to another maintaining all constraints and rules (foreign keys, unique constraints, custom validations), Isolation provides concurrent transaction execution without interference using isolation levels like Read Uncommitted (allows dirty reads seeing uncommitted changes), Read Committed (prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads), Repeatable Read (prevents non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads), and Serializable (complete isolation as if transactions executed sequentially), and Durability guarantees committed transactions survive system failures through write-ahead logging (WAL) where changes are written to durable log before updating data files, implemented via two-phase commit for distributed transactions coordinating multiple databases, MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) allowing readers to access old versions while writers create new versions avoiding locks, pessimistic locking acquiring locks before accessing data preventing conflicts but reducing concurrency, optimistic locking checking for conflicts before commit using version numbers or timestamps allowing high concurrency but requiring retry logic, and database logs for recovery replaying committed transactions and rolling back uncommitted ones after crashes, with trade-offs including performance overhead from ACID guarantees reducing throughput compared to non-ACID systems, strict consistency limiting availability during partitions per CAP theorem, and increased complexity in distributed databases requiring coordination protocols, but providing strong guarantees essential for financial transactions, inventory management, booking systems, and other critical operations where data integrity cannot be compromised.
