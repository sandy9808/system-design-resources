Availability refers to the percentage of time a system remains operational and accessible when required for use. It is typically measured as uptime divided by total time and expressed as a percentage or in nines. For example five nines availability means 99.999% uptime which translates to approximately 5 minutes of downtime per year. High availability is crucial for mission-critical systems and is achieved through redundancy failover mechanisms and eliminating single points of failure. Redundancy involves having backup components or systems that can take over when primary components fail. This can be achieved through active-active configurations where multiple instances handle requests simultaneously or active-passive configurations where backup instances remain on standby until needed. Failover is the process of automatically switching to a redundant or standby system when the primary system fails. This requires health checks and monitoring to detect failures quickly and mechanisms to redirect traffic to healthy instances. Load balancers play a key role in availability by distributing traffic across multiple servers and removing failed servers from the rotation. Geographic distribution of servers across multiple data centers or regions improves availability by protecting against regional outages. Database replication ensures data availability by maintaining copies of data on multiple servers. Regular backups and disaster recovery plans are essential for maintaining availability during catastrophic failures. When designing for high availability consider the costs as achieving higher availability requires more resources and complexity. The goal is to balance availability requirements with cost constraints based on business needs.
