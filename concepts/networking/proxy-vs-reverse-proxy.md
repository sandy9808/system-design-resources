A Proxy (forward proxy) sits between clients and the internet acting on behalf of clients to fetch resources while hiding client identity, enabling access control, content filtering, caching frequently accessed content, bypassing geo-restrictions, and improving privacy by masking client IP addresses from destination servers, commonly used in corporate networks for monitoring employee internet usage and restricting access to certain websites, while a Reverse Proxy sits in front of backend servers acting on behalf of servers to handle client requests, providing load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers, SSL termination to offload encryption/decryption from application servers, caching static content at the edge to reduce backend load, compression and optimization of responses, protection against DDoS attacks and malicious traffic, enabling A/B testing and canary deployments, and hiding internal server architecture from clients—examples include NGINX and HAProxy as reverse proxies, while Squid and company VPNs serve as forward proxies, with the key distinction being forward proxies protect and anonymize clients while reverse proxies protect and optimize servers, and modern CDNs function as globally distributed reverse proxies caching content closer to users for improved performance and reduced latency.
