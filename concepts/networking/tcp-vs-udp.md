TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that establishes connections via three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), guarantees delivery of all packets in correct order through sequence numbers and acknowledgments, implements flow control using sliding window to prevent overwhelming receivers, provides congestion control adjusting transmission rate based on network conditions, and ensures data integrity through checksums, making it ideal for applications requiring reliability like web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP, IMAP), file transfers (FTP, SFTP), and SSH, but introduces overhead with larger headers (20+ bytes), connection establishment latency, and retransmission delays when packets are lost, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that sends datagrams without establishing connections, provides no guarantees of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection, uses minimal 8-byte headers for low overhead, enables broadcast and multicast communication, and achieves lower latency by eliminating connection setup and retransmission logic, making it perfect for real-time applications like video streaming, VoIP, online gaming, DNS queries, and IoT sensor data where occasional packet loss is acceptable but low latency is critical, with modern use cases including QUIC protocol (HTTP/3) building reliability features on top of UDP to combine UDP's speed with TCP's reliability, streaming protocols like WebRTC using UDP with application-layer error correction, and services implementing custom reliability mechanisms when needed while retaining UDP's performance benefits, where choice depends on whether application prioritizes reliability and ordering (TCP) or speed and low latency (UDP).
