IP Addresses are unique numerical identifiers assigned to devices on a network to enable communication using Internet Protocol, with IPv4 using 32-bit addresses (like 192.168.1.1) providing about 4.3 billion addresses and IPv6 using 128-bit addresses to solve address exhaustion with virtually unlimited address space, where addresses are divided into public addresses visible on internet and private addresses used within local networks (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), organized into classes (A, B, C for different network sizes) and managed through CIDR notation for flexible subnetting, with dynamic allocation via DHCP for automatic assignment and static allocation for servers requiring consistent addresses, supporting NAT (Network Address Translation) to allow multiple devices to share one public IP, and enabling routing decisions based on network and host portions of addresses, with special addresses like localhost (127.0.0.1), broadcast addresses for sending to all devices on network, and anycast addresses where same IP serves multiple destinations for load distribution and redundancy.
