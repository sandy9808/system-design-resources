HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web operating as a stateless request-response protocol where clients send requests (GET for retrieving data, POST for creating resources, PUT for updating, DELETE for removing, PATCH for partial updates, HEAD for metadata, OPTIONS for checking allowed methods) and servers respond with status codes (2xx for success, 3xx for redirects, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors), using headers to pass metadata like content type, caching policies, authentication tokens, and cookies for maintaining session state despite HTTP being stateless, while HTTPS is HTTP secured with TLS/SSL encryption providing confidentiality through encryption of all data in transit preventing eavesdropping, authenticity via digital certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities verifying server identity, and integrity ensuring data hasn't been tampered with during transmission, operating on port 443 instead of HTTP's port 80, using asymmetric encryption for initial handshake (server sends certificate with public key, client verifies and establishes shared secret) followed by symmetric encryption for actual data transfer due to performance efficiency, with modern requirements including HTTP/2 for multiplexing multiple requests over single connection, server push, and header compression, HTTP/3 using QUIC protocol over UDP for improved performance, mandatory HTTPS for security-sensitive operations like authentication and payment processing, HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers forcing browsers to only use HTTPS, and certificate pinning for critical applications to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
