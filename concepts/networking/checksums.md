Checksums are mathematical values calculated from data to verify integrity and detect errors during transmission or storage, where sender computes checksum from original data and transmits it alongside the data, receiver recalculates checksum from received data and compares with transmitted checksum to detect corruption, using algorithms like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection in network protocols and storage systems providing good error detection with low computational cost, MD5 and SHA family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) for cryptographic hashing ensuring file integrity and digital signatures, with simple checksums like modular addition or XOR used in protocols like IP and UDP for basic error detection, while more robust methods like TCP checksum covering entire packet including pseudoheader catch more errors, implemented at various layers like network layer for packet integrity, transport layer for end-to-end data verification, and application layer for file integrity verification during downloads or backups, with properties including deterministic output where same input always produces same checksum, avalanche effect where small changes in input produce completely different output, one-way function for cryptographic checksums preventing reverse engineering of original data, and collision resistance for security-critical applications ensuring different inputs don't produce same checksum, commonly used in protocols like Ethernet frames, IP packets, TCP/UDP segments, file systems for detecting disk corruption, distributed systems for verifying replicated data consistency, content-addressable storage systems using checksums as identifiers, and blockchain using cryptographic hashes for immutability, with limitations being checksums detect but don't correct errors requiring retransmission or redundancy for recovery, simple checksums may miss certain error patterns requiring stronger algorithms for critical applications, and computational overhead for cryptographic checksums requiring hardware acceleration for high-throughput systems.
