Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique for tracking and streaming database changes in real-time by monitoring transaction logs, enabling systems to react to data modifications without polling or triggers, implemented through Log-Based CDC reading database write-ahead logs (WAL) or binary logs capturing every insert, update, delete with minimal performance impact, Trigger-Based CDC using database triggers on tables to record changes in separate change table providing easy setup but adding overhead to write operations, Timestamp-Based CDC periodically querying for rows with modified_at timestamp newer than last check requiring timestamp columns and suffering from deletion detection issues, and Snapshot-Based CDC comparing current state with previous snapshot detecting differences but requiring significant computation for large datasets, popular solutions including Debezium connecting to various databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) streaming changes to Kafka with support for schema evolution and transformations, AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) continuously replicating database changes to various targets, Maxwell's Daemon tailing MySQL binary logs producing JSON to Kafka or other outputs, and database-native features like PostgreSQL logical replication or MongoDB change streams, use cases including Data Synchronization maintaining consistency across microservices databases, Event Sourcing capturing all state changes as events for audit trails and temporal queries, Cache Invalidation updating or removing cached data when source changes, Search Index Updates keeping Elasticsearch or other search engines synchronized, Analytics and Data Warehousing streaming operational data to analytical stores for near-real-time reporting, and Microservices Integration enabling services to react to data changes in other services, with patterns like Outbox Pattern where service writes to database and outbox table atomically with CDC publishing outbox entries ensuring reliable event publishing without dual-write problem, challenges including Initial Snapshot requiring consistent point-in-time capture of existing data before streaming changes, Schema Evolution handling database schema changes requiring transformation or versioning, Handling Deletes since deleted records don't exist requiring tombstone markers or soft deletes, Ordering Guarantees within entity while allowing parallelism across entities, and Operational Complexity of running and monitoring CDC pipelines with proper error handling and recovery.
