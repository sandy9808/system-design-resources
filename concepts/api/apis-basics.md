APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are contracts that define how software components communicate with each other, enabling different systems to exchange data and functionality through well-defined endpoints, methods, and data formats, where REST APIs use HTTP methods and stateless requests returning JSON/XML responses with resources identified by URLs, following principles like statelessness where each request contains all necessary information, client-server separation for independent evolution, cacheability for performance optimization, uniform interface using standard HTTP methods, and layered architecture allowing intermediaries like load balancers and caches, while modern alternatives include GraphQL allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single query reducing over-fetching and under-fetching, gRPC using Protocol Buffers for efficient binary serialization and HTTP/2 for multiplexing providing high performance for microservices communication, and WebSockets for bidirectional real-time communication, with API design best practices including versioning (via URL path /v1/, headers, or query parameters) to manage breaking changes, consistent naming conventions using nouns for resources and HTTP methods for actions, proper status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error), pagination for large datasets using offset/limit or cursor-based approaches, filtering and sorting capabilities, comprehensive error responses with error codes and messages, authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, or API keys, rate limiting to prevent abuse, CORS configuration for browser security, documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, and monitoring with logging, metrics, and distributed tracing for observability in production systems.
