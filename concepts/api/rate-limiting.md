Rate Limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specified time window to prevent abuse, ensure fair resource allocation, protect against DDoS attacks, manage costs for downstream services, and maintain quality of service for all users, implemented using algorithms like Fixed Window counting requests in fixed time periods (simple but allows bursts at window boundaries potentially doubling allowed rate), Sliding Window Log tracking timestamp of each request (accurate but memory intensive), Sliding Window Counter combining benefits of both using weighted counts from previous and current window, Token Bucket adding tokens at fixed rate with requests consuming tokens allowing controlled bursts while enforcing average rate, and Leaky Bucket processing requests at constant rate queueing excess (smooths traffic but adds latency), stored in fast key-value stores like Redis using keys like "user:123:minute" with atomic increment operations and TTL for automatic cleanup, returning 429 Too Many Requests status with Retry-After header indicating when client can retry, including rate limit information in response headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) for client awareness, with strategies including per-user limits preventing individual users from hogging resources, per-IP limits catching malicious actors, per-API-key limits for programmatic access, tiered limits based on subscription level (free tier 100 req/hour, paid tier 10000 req/hour), different limits for different endpoints based on cost and sensitivity, distributed rate limiting using centralized Redis cluster or coordination between nodes for consistency, local rate limiting with eventual consistency for better performance, and combining multiple strategies for comprehensive protection, challenges include handling clock skew in distributed systems, ensuring fair limiting across multiple servers, graceful degradation when rate limiter is down, dealing with shared IPs (corporate NATs, VPNs), and providing users with visibility into their usage and limits through dashboards and alerts.
