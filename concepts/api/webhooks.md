Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that enable event-driven communication where a service sends real-time notifications to a specified URL when specific events occur, inverting the traditional request-response pattern by having the server push data to clients instead of clients polling for updates, commonly used for GitHub notifying CI/CD systems about new commits, payment processors like Stripe sending transaction confirmations, Slack delivering messages to external services, and monitoring systems alerting on threshold breaches, implemented by registering webhook URLs at the provider, the provider sending POST requests with event payload to registered URLs when events occur, and receiver validating authenticity via signatures (HMAC with shared secret), processing the payload, and returning 2xx status code to acknowledge receipt, with best practices including idempotent handling since providers may retry on failures or timeouts, signature verification to prevent spoofing, asynchronous processing by immediately returning success and processing payload in background workers to avoid timeouts, retry logic with exponential backoff for failed deliveries, dead letter queues for persistently failing webhooks, versioning webhook payloads to handle schema evolution, providing webhook management UI for users to add/remove/test webhooks, logging all webhook deliveries for debugging, implementing circuit breakers to stop calling consistently failing endpoints, and requiring HTTPS for secure transmission, with scalability challenges including handling spikes in webhook traffic during events, maintaining delivery guarantees requiring persistent queues, security concerns around webhook URL validation and payload verification, debugging difficulties due to asynchronous nature, and providers needing retry mechanisms and delivery status tracking to ensure reliable event delivery despite network failures or receiver downtime.
