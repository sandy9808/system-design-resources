The CAP theorem states that in a distributed data store it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee all three of the following properties Consistency Availability and Partition Tolerance and you can only achieve two out of three at any given time. Consistency means that all nodes see the same data at the same time and every read receives the most recent write or an error. Availability means that every request receives a response without guarantee that it contains the most recent write. Partition Tolerance means that the system continues to operate despite network partitions that prevent some nodes from communicating with others. In practice partition tolerance is mandatory for distributed systems because network failures will inevitably occur so the real choice is between consistency and availability during a partition. CP systems choose consistency over availability meaning during a network partition the system will return errors or timeouts rather than potentially stale data. Examples include traditional relational databases with strong consistency HBase and MongoDB with default settings. AP systems choose availability over consistency meaning during a network partition the system continues to operate and accept reads and writes but different nodes might return different data until the partition is resolved. Examples include Cassandra DynamoDB and Couchbase. CA systems provide consistency and availability but cannot tolerate partitions which is only realistic for single-node systems or systems where network partitions are considered impossible. Most modern systems aim for eventual consistency which is a form of weak consistency where the system guarantees that if no new updates are made to an object eventually all accesses will return the last updated value. This allows for high availability while providing consistency over time. Understanding CAP theorem helps in making informed decisions about database selection and system architecture based on specific requirements.
