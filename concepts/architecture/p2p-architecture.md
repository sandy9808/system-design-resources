Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture connects nodes directly without central servers where each peer acts as both client and server contributing resources (storage, bandwidth, processing) and consuming from others, creating decentralized network resistant to single point of failure, implemented using Unstructured P2P like early Gnutella and BitTorrent where peers connect to random neighbors, content located through flooding queries across network, providing simplicity and robustness against churn but suffering from inefficient search requiring many messages and potential network congestion, Structured P2P like Chord, Kademlia, and Pastry using Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to deterministically map keys to nodes enabling O(log N) lookup complexity where each peer maintains routing table to subset of peers, searches navigate toward target using distance metrics, guaranteeing content found if exists with efficient logarithmic hops but requiring more complex membership management, and Hybrid P2P combining P2P with super-nodes or index servers like Skype and Spotify where high-capability peers act as temporary coordinators for subsets of network providing balance between decentralization and efficiency, using techniques like Bootstrapping discovering initial peers through bootstrap servers, known peer addresses, or DHT seed nodes, Peer Discovery finding new peers through gossiping neighbor lists, DHT lookup, or tracker servers, NAT Traversal establishing connections across firewalls and NATs using STUN/TURN servers or hole punching, and Sybil Attack Resistance preventing malicious actors from creating many fake identities to subvert network through proof-of-work, reputation systems, or social graphs, implementing Content Distribution like BitTorrent where files split into pieces, peers exchange piece availability, downloaders become uploaders (seeders) incentivizing sharing through tit-for-tat protocol, tracker coordinates peer discovery (or trackerless DHT), and protocol optimizes piece selection (rarest first) maximizing download speed and availability, benefits including Scalability increasing capacity as nodes join since each adds resources, Decentralization eliminating single point of failure and censorship resistance, Cost Efficiency distributing costs across participants without centralized infrastructure, and Bandwidth Efficiency utilizing distributed upload capacity preventing server bottlenecks, challenges including Discovery finding content without central index requiring distributed search, Security trust issues without central authority requiring encryption and authentication, Consistency maintaining data consistency across replicas, Free-Rider Problem where peers consume without contributing managed through incentive mechanisms or enforcement, Churn handling frequent joins and departures requiring redundancy and repair mechanisms, and Legal Concerns around copyright infringement in file sharing networks, use cases including File Sharing (BitTorrent, eMule) distributing large files efficiently, Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) maintaining distributed ledger without central authority, Content Delivery (IPFS) creating permanent web with content-addressed storage, Voice/Video Chat (WebRTC) enabling direct peer connections reducing server costs and latency, Collaborative Editing (CRDT-based tools) allowing simultaneous editing without central coordination, and Distributed Computing (BOINC) aggregating spare CPU cycles for scientific research, protocols like WebRTC enabling P2P in browsers with NAT traversal, BitTorrent optimizing large file distribution, IPFS providing content-addressed immutable storage, and libp2p offering modular P2P networking stack supporting multiple transports and protocols, modern applications include blockchain networks, decentralized social media, and edge computing where peers collaborate for computation and storage without relying on centralized cloud providers.
