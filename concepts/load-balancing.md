Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load thereby improving responsiveness and availability of applications. Load balancers sit between clients and servers intercepting requests and routing them to available servers based on various algorithms. Common load balancing algorithms include Round Robin which distributes requests sequentially across servers Least Connections which sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections IP Hash which uses the client's IP address to determine which server receives the request Weighted Round Robin which assigns weights to servers based on their capacity and Least Response Time which routes to the server with the quickest response time. Load balancers can operate at different layers of the OSI model. Layer 4 load balancers operate at the transport layer making routing decisions based on IP address and TCP or UDP port without inspecting packet content providing fast performance. Layer 7 load balancers operate at the application layer making routing decisions based on content of the request such as HTTP headers cookies or application data enabling content-based routing and SSL termination. Health checks are essential for load balancers to monitor server health and automatically remove unhealthy servers from the pool. Session persistence or sticky sessions ensure that requests from the same client are routed to the same server which is important for applications that store session state locally. Load balancers can be hardware-based dedicated physical devices or software-based such as HAProxy Nginx or cloud-based solutions like AWS ELB. Benefits include improved application availability and responsiveness prevention of server overload seamless scaling and maintenance without downtime.
