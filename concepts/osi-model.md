The OSI Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves specific functions and communicates with the layers directly above and below it. The seven layers from bottom to top are Physical Data Link Network Transport Session Presentation and Application. The Physical layer deals with the transmission of raw bits over a physical medium handling aspects like voltage levels cable specifications and physical connectors such as Ethernet cables fiber optics and wireless signals. The Data Link layer provides node-to-node data transfer handling MAC addresses frame synchronization error detection and correction and controls access to the physical medium through protocols like Ethernet WiFi and PPP. The Network layer is responsible for routing packets across networks using IP addresses implementing routing algorithms and handling packet forwarding fragmentation and reassembly with protocols like IP ICMP and routing protocols. The Transport layer ensures reliable data transfer between end systems providing segmentation flow control error detection and retransmission using protocols like TCP for reliable connection-oriented communication and UDP for connectionless fast communication. The Session layer manages sessions between applications establishing maintaining and terminating connections handling dialog control and synchronization. The Presentation layer handles data format translation encryption and compression ensuring that data sent by the application layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another system dealing with character encoding data compression and encryption. The Application layer is the topmost layer that interacts directly with end-user applications providing network services to applications through protocols like HTTP HTTPS FTP SMTP DNS and others. Understanding the OSI model helps in troubleshooting network issues as problems can be isolated to specific layers designing network architectures by understanding how different protocols interact comparing different networking technologies and protocols and communicating about network concepts using standardized terminology. In practice the TCP/IP model is more commonly used which compresses the OSI layers into four layers Network Interface Internet Transport and Application but the OSI model remains valuable for educational purposes and detailed protocol analysis.
