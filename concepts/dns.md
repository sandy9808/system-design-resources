Domain Name System DNS is a hierarchical distributed naming system that translates human-readable domain names like google.com into IP addresses like 172.217.164.46 that computers use to identify each other on networks. DNS is essential for the internet functioning as the phone book of the internet. The DNS hierarchy consists of root servers at the top level which know about TLD servers top-level domain servers like .com .org .net which know about authoritative name servers and authoritative name servers which contain actual DNS records for domains. DNS resolution process starts when user types URL in browser browser checks local DNS cache if not found queries recursive DNS resolver typically provided by ISP recursive resolver checks its cache if not found queries root server root server responds with TLD server address resolver queries TLD server TLD responds with authoritative name server resolver queries authoritative server authoritative server responds with IP address resolver caches result and returns to browser. DNS record types include A records mapping domain to IPv4 address AAAA records mapping to IPv6 address CNAME records creating aliases pointing one domain to another MX records specifying mail servers for domain TXT records storing text information used for verification NS records specifying name servers for domain SOA records containing administrative information and PTR records for reverse DNS lookups. DNS caching occurs at multiple levels including browser cache operating system cache local network router ISP recursive resolver and DNS server cache with each level having different TTL Time To Live values. TTL determines how long DNS records are cached before refresh with shorter TTLs allowing faster changes but more queries and longer TTLs reducing load but slower updates. DNS propagation is the time it takes for DNS changes to spread across internet when you update DNS records changes don't happen instantly they propagate to various DNS servers worldwide depending on TTL values typically taking minutes to 48 hours. For high availability implement multiple authoritative name servers distribute across geographic locations use anycast routing for load distribution implement health checks monitor DNS query patterns and have redundancy at ISP level. DNS security concerns include DNS spoofing or cache poisoning where attackers inject false DNS data DNS amplification attacks using DNS for DDoS man-in-the-middle attacks intercepting DNS queries and domain hijacking unauthorized changes to DNS records. DNSSEC DNS Security Extensions adds authentication to DNS using digital signatures to verify authenticity prevents cache poisoning ensures data integrity but doesn't provide confidentiality. DNS load balancing uses DNS to distribute traffic by returning different IP addresses for same domain rotating IPs in round-robin fashion considering geographic location of requester using weighted responses and integrating with health checks. For performance use CDN with anycast DNS implement geo-DNS for location-based routing use low TTL for frequently changing services optimize query response times and use DNS prefetching in browsers. Common DNS problems include propagation delays causing inconsistent responses misconfigured DNS records TTL set too high or low DNS server failures DNS query timeouts and split-horizon DNS for internal versus external.
