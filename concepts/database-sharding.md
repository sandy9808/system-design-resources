Database sharding is a database architecture pattern that horizontally partitions data across multiple database instances where each shard contains a subset of the total data. Sharding becomes necessary when a single database cannot handle the load or store all the data efficiently. Each shard operates as an independent database and collectively the shards make up the complete dataset. Common sharding strategies include Range-based sharding where data is divided based on ranges of a key such as user IDs 1-1000 in shard 1 and 1001-2000 in shard 2 Hash-based sharding where a hash function is applied to the shard key to determine which shard stores the data providing better distribution Geographic sharding where data is partitioned based on location placing user data in the region closest to them and Directory-based sharding where a lookup service maintains a mapping of which shard contains which data. Choosing the right shard key is critical as it affects data distribution query performance and ability to maintain relationships. A good shard key should distribute data evenly avoid hot spots support common query patterns and remain relatively stable over time. Challenges with sharding include increased complexity in application code loss of referential integrity across shards difficulty with joins and aggregations across shards uneven data distribution leading to hot shards and complexity in rebalancing when adding or removing shards. Cross-shard queries require scatter-gather operations where queries are sent to all shards and results are aggregated. Database transactions across shards are difficult requiring distributed transaction protocols. Resharding when data grows unevenly is complex and often requires downtime. Despite challenges sharding provides virtually unlimited horizontal scalability improved query performance through parallelization better fault isolation as failure of one shard doesn't affect others and geographic distribution for regulatory compliance.
