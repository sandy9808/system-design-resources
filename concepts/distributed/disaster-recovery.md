Disaster Recovery (DR) encompasses strategies and processes for recovering systems and data after catastrophic failures including natural disasters, hardware failures, cyber attacks, or human errors, measured by RTO (Recovery Time Objective) defining maximum acceptable downtime between failure and restoration where lower RTO requires more expensive hot standby solutions, and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) specifying maximum acceptable data loss measured in time where lower RPO demands more frequent backups or synchronous replication with zero RPO requiring real-time data mirroring, implemented through tiered strategies including Cold Standby (backup and restore) storing regular backups offsite with no running infrastructure providing lowest cost but highest RTO (hours to days) requiring manual intervention to provision resources, restore data, and reconfigure applications, Warm Standby maintaining scaled-down infrastructure in secondary region with data regularly synchronized providing medium RTO (minutes to hours) and reasonable cost where systems can be scaled up during failover, and Hot Standby (active-passive) running fully provisioned parallel environment with real-time replication providing lowest RTO (seconds to minutes) but highest cost with immediate failover capability, or Active-Active (multi-region) serving traffic from multiple regions simultaneously providing continuous availability but requiring sophisticated data synchronization and conflict resolution, using techniques like Geographic Replication spreading data across regions or availability zones ensuring survival of regional failures, Cross-Region Backups storing backups in different geographic location than primary system protecting against regional disasters, Pilot Light maintaining minimal infrastructure (databases, core services) with ability to quickly scale up reducing cost while maintaining moderate RTO, and Backup Strategies combining Full Backups capturing complete system state, Incremental Backups storing only changes since last backup reducing time and storage, and Differential Backups capturing changes since last full backup balancing recovery speed and efficiency, automated through Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) enabling rapid environment recreation, automated testing regularly verifying recovery procedures through DR drills preventing surprises during actual disasters, and runbooks documenting detailed step-by-step recovery procedures, with data protection using snapshots for point-in-time recovery, continuous replication via log shipping or CDC, versioning enabling recovery from accidental deletions or corruptions, and immutable backups preventing ransomware from destroying recovery options, monitoring system health, replication lag, backup success, and infrastructure readiness with alerting on anomalies, challenges including Cost vs RTO tradeoff where faster recovery demands more redundant infrastructure, Data Consistency ensuring replicas contain valid data especially during partial failures, Failover Testing requiring regular drills without disrupting production, Capacity Planning ensuring DR environment handles full production load, and Failback Strategy safely returning to primary region after recovery, compliance requirements often mandating specific RPO/RTO targets and backup retention policies particularly for financial and healthcare data, implemented using cloud services like AWS with multi-AZ deployment, cross-region replication, automated backups, and Route53 health checks for failover, or multi-cloud strategy avoiding vendor lock-in and cloud provider outages at cost of increased complexity.
