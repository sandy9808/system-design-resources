Scalability is the capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system. It refers to the ability of a system to grow and manage increased demand without performance degradation. There are two main types of scaling vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling also known as scaling up involves adding more power to existing machines such as adding more CPU RAM or storage to a single server. This approach has limitations as there is a maximum capacity that a single machine can achieve and it can become a single point of failure. Horizontal scaling also known as scaling out involves adding more machines to the pool of resources. This approach distributes the load across multiple servers and can theoretically scale infinitely by adding more machines. Horizontal scaling provides better fault tolerance as the failure of one machine does not bring down the entire system. When designing for scalability consider factors like load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across servers caching to reduce database load database sharding to partition data across multiple databases asynchronous processing to handle time-consuming tasks without blocking the main application flow and CDN usage to serve static content from geographically distributed servers. Scalability challenges include maintaining data consistency across distributed systems managing state in a distributed environment handling network latency and ensuring that the system can scale both reads and writes effectively. Microservices architecture often helps with scalability by breaking down monolithic applications into smaller independent services that can be scaled individually based on their specific needs.
