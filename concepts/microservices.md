Microservices architecture is an approach to building applications as a collection of small independent services that communicate over network protocols. Each microservice is designed around a specific business capability runs in its own process and can be deployed independently. This contrasts with monolithic architecture where all functionality exists in a single codebase and deployment unit. Key principles of microservices include single responsibility where each service does one thing well loose coupling where services are independent and changes to one don't require changes to others high cohesion where related functionality is grouped together autonomous deployment where services can be deployed independently without affecting others and decentralized data management where each service manages its own database. Benefits of microservices include independent scalability where services can be scaled based on their specific needs technology diversity allowing different services to use different programming languages and databases faster deployment cycles as small teams can deploy changes independently better fault isolation where failure in one service doesn't crash the entire system and easier maintenance as smaller codebases are easier to understand and modify. Challenges include increased operational complexity as managing many services requires sophisticated DevOps practices distributed system complexity including network latency and partial failures difficulty with distributed transactions and maintaining data consistency testing complexity as integration tests become more complex increased resource usage as each service needs its own runtime and dependencies and the need for service discovery mechanisms. Communication between microservices can be synchronous using REST or gRPC or asynchronous using message queues. API gateways provide a single entry point for clients handling routing authentication and aggregation. Service mesh technologies like Istio provide infrastructure for service-to-service communication including load balancing service discovery and security.
