Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table by assigning them a position on an abstract circle or hash ring. This technique is particularly useful for distributing data across a cluster of cache servers or databases. In traditional hashing when the number of servers changes most keys need to be remapped causing a massive redistribution of data. Consistent hashing minimizes this by ensuring that when a server is added or removed only a small fraction of keys need to be remapped. The algorithm works by hashing both the servers and the keys onto the same hash space usually represented as a ring from 0 to 2^32-1. Each key is assigned to the first server encountered while moving clockwise around the ring. When a server is added it takes over responsibility for keys from its neighboring servers and when a server is removed its keys are redistributed to the next server in the ring. Virtual nodes are an enhancement where each physical server is represented by multiple positions on the ring improving load distribution and handling heterogeneous server capacities. Consistent hashing is used by many distributed systems including Amazon DynamoDB Apache Cassandra Memcached clusters and CDNs for cache distribution. The benefits include minimal disruption when scaling the cluster load balancing across servers and the ability to handle server failures gracefully. However consistent hashing does not guarantee perfectly uniform distribution and can lead to hot spots if not implemented with virtual nodes.
