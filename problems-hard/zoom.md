Zoom provides real-time video conferencing supporting thousands of participants requiring low latency, high quality, and reliability, functional requirements including creating and joining meetings, video and audio streaming, screen sharing, recording, chat messaging, breakout rooms, reactions and polls, waiting room, meeting controls (mute, remove), virtual backgrounds, and integration with calendars, architecture using Signaling Server establishing peer connections, Media Servers (SFUs - Selective Forwarding Units) routing video/audio streams, Recording Service capturing meetings, Chat Service handling messages, API Gateway managing authentication and routing, User Service managing accounts and settings, Analytics Service tracking usage and quality, and Cloud Storage for recordings, WebRTC implementation using ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) discovering network paths through STUN/TURN servers finding public IPs and relaying when direct connection impossible, DTLS-SRTP encrypting media end-to-end, SDP (Session Description Protocol) negotiating codecs and parameters, offering VP8/VP9 for video and Opus for audio providing quality and bandwidth efficiency, jitter buffer smoothing network variations, and adaptive bitrate adjusting quality based on bandwidth, connection flow where client initiates join sending meeting ID and credentials, Signaling Server validates and creates session, returns list of Media Servers, Client establishes WebRTC connections to SFU uploading one high-quality stream, SFU forwards to other participants at appropriate quality, Participants download multiple streams simulcast layers or SVC scalable video coding, Client renders videos in gallery or speaker view dynamically switching layouts, media routing using SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) architecture where each client uploads video once to SFU, SFU forwards to all participants without transcoding minimizing latency and server CPU, supports simulcast where client uploads multiple qualities (high, medium, low), SFU selects appropriate layer per recipient based on bandwidth and layout (gallery vs thumbnail), advantages including low latency (vs MCU Multipoint

Detection testing network before meeting recommending settings, Quality Adjustments automatically downgrading when bandwidth insufficient, Network Redundancy using multiple paths simultaneously switching on failure, Packet Loss Concealment interpolating missing frames, and Preferred Region selection for lowest latency and regulatory compliance, security and privacy implementing End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) where only participants can decrypt using per-meeting keys, Waiting Room admitting participants individually preventing unauthorized access, Password Protection requiring code to join, Meeting Lock preventing new joiners mid-meeting, Participant Authentication requiring login or SSO, Host Controls removing, muting, disabling features for participants, Encryption in Transit all signaling and media encrypted, Data Residency storing in specific regions for compliance, Security Icons indicating encryption status, and Compliance certifications SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, features and
