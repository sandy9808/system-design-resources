Designing Netflix requires building a video streaming platform that delivers high-quality video content to millions of concurrent users worldwide with minimal buffering and supports features like recommendations personalization and offline viewing. Core requirements include streaming videos in multiple quality levels supporting millions of concurrent viewers with low latency handling different network conditions with adaptive bitrate streaming providing personalized recommendations storing and serving petabytes of video content supporting offline downloads on mobile devices tracking watch history and resume playback and serving users globally with minimal latency. The system architecture includes client applications on various devices API gateway for routing user service for authentication and profiles video service for metadata catalog service for browsing content recommendation service for personalized suggestions encoding service for video processing CDN for content delivery streaming service for video playback analytics service for viewing patterns and appropriate storage systems. For video storage and delivery store master video files in object storage encode videos in multiple formats and bitrates for adaptive streaming distribute encoded videos to CDN edge locations worldwide use protocols like HLS or DASH for streaming and implement adaptive bitrate streaming where client automatically switches quality based on bandwidth. The video encoding pipeline involves uploading master video file splitting video into chunks encoding each chunk in multiple resolutions like 4K 1080p 720p 480p 360p generating thumbnails and preview clips storing all versions in object storage and pushing to CDN edge servers. The content delivery uses a multi-tier CDN architecture with Open Connect appliances deployed at ISPs for serving 95% of traffic regional CDN caches for popular content and origin servers as fallback. For recommendations use collaborative filtering based on viewing patterns content-based filtering using video metadata deep learning models for personalization and A/B testing for algorithm improvements. The data model includes users table with user_id subscription_tier preferences videos table with video_id title description genre duration cast watch_history table with user_id video_id timestamp progress and ratings table with user_id video_id rating. For playback tracking maintain viewing position in real-time using Redis sync across devices when user switches and resume from last position on any device. The search functionality uses Elasticsearch with autocomplete fuzzy search filtering by genre year rating and ranking based on popularity and relevance. For scalability use microservices architecture shard databases by user_id or video_id implement caching aggressively use message queues for async processing like encoding deploy in multiple AWS regions and use multi-region active-active setup for disaster recovery. Additional features include user profiles for family sharing parental controls content ratings live streaming for events interactive content like Bandersnatch download management with DRM and admin portal for content management.
