Tinder enables users to discover matches through swiping requiring real-time matching, efficient profile discovery, and scalable messaging, functional requirements including creating profiles with photos and bio, discovering nearby users through swiping, matching when both users swipe right, real-time messaging between matches, super likes and boosts for premium features, profile verification, and blocking/reporting users, architecture using Profile Service managing user data and photos, Discovery Service showing potential matches based on location and preferences, Matching Service detecting mutual likes creating matches, Messaging Service enabling real-time chat, Geolocation Service finding nearby users, Recommendation Engine personalizing discovery feed based on behavior, and Notification Service alerting about matches and messages, user profile storage using Relational Database (PostgreSQL) for user data with structured queries, Object Storage (S3) for photos with CDN distribution, NoSQL (MongoDB) for preference settings and filters allowing flexible schemas, and Cache (Redis) for active user sessions and recent swipes, geolocation implementing Geospatial Index using Redis GeoHash or PostgreSQL PostGIS indexing coordinates enabling radius searches, Grid-Based Sharding dividing world into geographic cells with separate indexes per region, and Location Updates tracking user position periodically updating when movement exceeds threshold balancing accuracy with battery and privacy, discovery feed generating candidate pool by querying users within radius (typically 50-100 km), filtering by age range, gender preferences, and distance settings, applying business rules excluding already swiped, blocked, or matched users, ranking candidates using ELO-based scoring predicting mutual attraction, activity recency prioritizing active users, profile completeness favoring quality profiles, and randomization preventing same order for everyone, presenting as stack where user swipes right (like) or left (pass) with decisions recorded immediately, matching logic storing swipes in database with user_id, target_id, direction (like/pass), timestamp, checking for reciprocal like when user swipes right querying if target previously liked them, creating match record immediately when mutual like detected, and triggering notifications to both users instantly via push notification and in-app alert, implementing Double-Write Strategy where swipe recorded in both directions enabling fast mutual like detection, or Event-Driven Architecture publishing swipe events with matching service consuming and detecting matches asynchronously, messaging using WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication, Message Queue (Kafka) for reliable delivery and offline support, MongoDB for message history with indexes on conversation_id and timestamp, and Encryption end-to-end for privacy with keys managed per conversation, conversation storage partitioning by user_id or conversation_id, storing messages with sender, receiver, content, timestamp, read status, media attachments, implementing pagination for loading history with recent messages cached, read receipts updating status asynchronously, and typing indicators broadcasting through WebSocket, premium features including Super Like highlighting profile to recipient with special notification, Boost temporarily increasing profile visibility by showing more frequently, Unlimited Swipes removing daily limits for free users (typically 100), Rewind allowing undo of last swipe, Passport changing location to discover users elsewhere, and Read Receipts showing message read status, safety and verification implementing Photo Verification using AI comparing selfie with profile photos, Social Media Integration linking Instagram or Spotify for authenticity, Reporting and Blocking marking malicious users for review, Manual Review team investigating reports, and Automated Detection using ML identifying bots, scams, inappropriate content, data models including User with profile data, preferences, subscription status, location, photos with order and verification status, Swipe with user, target, direction, timestamp, Match with both users, match timestamp, conversation_id, last message preview, Message with conversation, sender, content, timestamp, read status, media URLs, scaling through Geographic Sharding partitioning users by location with regional clusters, Database Sharding by user_id for profiles and conversations, Microservices Architecture decoupling discovery, matching, messaging enabling independent scaling, Caching aggressively storing active profiles, recent swipes, online status, and CDN for photos reducing origin load, real-time features using WebSocket for messaging and live updates, Push Notifications via FCM/APNS for matches and messages when app closed, Presence System tracking online status using heartbeats with Redis, and Event Streaming (Kafka) for activity feeds and analytics, recommendation algorithm using Collaborative Filtering analyzing swipe patterns finding similar taste, Content-Based Filtering matching profile attributes and stated preferences, Bandit Algorithms balancing exploration of new profiles with exploitation of successful patterns, Learning from Rejections understanding what users don't like, and Diversity Injection preventing filter bubbles by occasionally showing varied profiles, privacy and security implementing Location Obfuscation showing approximate distance not exact coordinates, Data Encryption for messages and sensitive data, GDPR Compliance with data export and deletion, Age Verification preventing underage usage, and Rate Limiting preventing scraping and abuse, matching optimization using Bloom Filters quickly checking if already swiped before database query, Batch Processing periodically checking for matches in bulk for efficiency, Probabilistic Data Structures like HyperLogLog estimating mutual friends, and Precomputed Recommendations generating likely matches during low traffic, discovery challenges including Cold Start for new users without swipe history using demographic defaults and rapid learning, Geographic Coverage balancing local users with variety, Gender Ratio Imbalance showing more profiles to underrepresented gender, and Seasonality adapting to usage patterns varying by time and location, metrics tracking Daily Active Users showing engagement, Swipe Volume and match rate indicating algorithm effectiveness, Message Response Rate measuring conversation quality, Subscription Conversion from free to premium, and Retention tracking user return patterns, storage optimization using Image Compression reducing photo sizes, Thumbnail Generation for quick loading, Lazy Loading deferring non-visible photos, and Content Delivery Network distributing globally, monetization through Premium Subscriptions (Tinder Plus, Gold, Platinum), In-App Purchases for boosts and super likes, Advertising showing sponsored profiles, and Partnerships with brands for experiences, challenges including Fake Profiles and bots requiring detection and removal, Ghosting where matches never respond affecting user experience, Privacy Concerns around location sharing requiring careful controls, Algorithmic Bias ensuring fair representation, and Competition requiring continuous innovation, modern features including Video Profiles and video chat for authentic interaction, Interests and Passions displaying hobbies for better matching, Interactive Prompts replacing text bios, Face-to-Face video dates before meeting, Background Checks for premium users, and Social Events organizing group meetups, scalability handling millions of concurrent users swiping, billions of swipes daily, real-time matching detection, global message delivery, and petabytes of photos through distributed architecture with geographic distribution, horizontal scaling, efficient indexing, and intelligent caching creating successful dating platform connecting millions worldwide.
