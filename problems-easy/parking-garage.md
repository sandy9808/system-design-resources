Designing a parking garage system requires managing parking spots vehicle entry and exit fee calculation and potentially reservations. Requirements include tracking available parking spots assigning spots to vehicles calculating parking fees based on duration handling multiple parking levels and spot types supporting entry and exit gates and providing real-time availability information. The system components include entry gate with barrier and ticket dispenser exit gate with barrier and payment terminal parking spot sensors to detect occupancy central management system for coordination display panels showing available spots and payment kiosks. The database schema needs tables for parking_spots with columns like spot_id level spot_type is_occupied vehicle_type vehicles table with vehicle_id license_plate entry_time spot_id and transactions table with transaction_id vehicle_id entry_time exit_time duration fee payment_status. Parking spot types can include compact regular large handicapped electric_vehicle and motorcycle with different pricing. The entry flow involves vehicle arriving at entry gate system capturing license plate using camera or manual entry system finding available spot matching vehicle type system dispensing ticket with timestamp and spot assignment barrier opening to allow entry and display board updating available count. The exit flow involves vehicle arriving at exit gate with ticket system calculating fee based on duration and spot type system presenting payment options including credit_card cash mobile_payment displaying fee on screen and processing payment barrier opening after successful payment marking spot as available and updating display boards. For finding available spots use algorithms like first available which assigns nearest available spot best fit which matches vehicle size to spot size or level-based which fills lower levels first. Real-time updates can be achieved using WebSocket connections to push availability to mobile apps database triggers to update counts and event-driven architecture with message queues. Scalability considerations include using caching for frequently accessed data like availability counts implementing read replicas for high read traffic and partitioning data by garage location. Additional features include reservation system allowing advance booking mobile app for finding spots and navigation integration with payment systems like Apple Pay integration with license plate recognition cameras and analytics dashboard for utilization rates peak hours and revenue.
